# Semantic Analysis of Text using NLP

##  Overview
Semantic analysis is a crucial component of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that focuses on understanding the meaning and context of language beyond surface-level syntax. This project explores techniques to extract, interpret, and classify the semantic content of text for tasks such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and intent recognition.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze the **contextual meaning** of sentences and phrases in natural language.
- Classify text based on **sentiment**, **intent**, or **topic**.
- Leverage **semantic embeddings** and **pretrained language models** for deeper understanding.

---

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal
- **Embedding Generation**: Using Word2Vec, GloVe, or transformer-based models like BERT
- **Semantic Similarity**: Cosine similarity, clustering, and sentence embeddings
- **Sentiment & Intent Detection**: Multiclass classification using fine-tuned models
- **Visualization**: Word clouds, similarity graphs, and dimensionality reduction (TSNE/PCA)

---

##  Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **NLTK**, **spaCy**, **Transformers (Hugging Face)**
- **scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly** (for visualizations)

---

##  Use Cases
-  Customer feedback analysis
-  Chatbot intent classification
-  News clustering and topic tagging
-  Clinical text mining and entity linking
